  (Coast)

The hardest thing about working as a computer programmer was we need to consider a trade-off between efficiency and cost.
There often is not a single correct answer to design a software and coding, 
so we need to evaluate different approaches to determine the best solutions for our project.

Even though there is no certain but there are the best practices that suggested by many people who consider earlier for a long time. 
It's important to understand why others have solved similar problems in certain ways, 
as this can provide valuable insights and help us make informed decisions.


**2. Are you comfortable working with a team of programmers to complete coding projects?**

Working in a team offers me a chance to see and learn how others work.
We need to find a happy medium when we have conflicting ideas.
I am looking forward to extract the best from every person I work with.

* If you have a project and have strict time contraints how would you deal with the stress and dissuade it.

I have already experienced that with someone in my workplace before.
I dealt with it in this way:
I took the person to one side away from the group and spoke to them in private.
Explained to them the importance of them being an active participant in our success and that reflects on the success of the team.

- Dissuade: to distress. deter. turn away from stress.
- We come to a happy medium

*** Describe how you would approach reviewing another team member’s  code**

I believe that teamwork is essential for developing innovative computer programs. 
I'm always excited to review another team member's code because it's a chance to learn something and improve the overall project. 
I would speak with the team member about their intention and then carefully review their code and provide thoughtful feedback.
