# S3

Section introduction

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS

-> ”infinitely scaling” storage

- Many websites use Amazon S3 as a backbone

- Many AWS services use Amazon S3 as an integration as well


### Amazon S3 Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes & big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static website

- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in **buckets** (directories)
- Buckets must have a globally unique name (
  -> across all regions all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region

### Security

**User-Based**
1. IAM Policies: which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

**Resource-Based**
2. Bucket Policies: bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
3. Object Access Control List (ACL): finer grain (can be disabled)
4. Bucket Access Control List (ACL): less common (can be disabled)
